# Correcting Survey Bias in Childhood Immunization Coverage Estimates Using Bayesian Post-Stratification: A Simulation-Based Study

### 1. Background of the Study
Reliable measurement of childhood immunization coverage is central to public health planning. Immunization surveys inform national strategies, track global progress toward Sustainable Development Goals, and guide resource allocation. Yet, survey-based estimates are vulnerable to nonresponse bias, coverage error, and measurement error-issues particularly pronounced in low- and middle-income countries where logistical constraints and uneven access affect data quality.

In Nigeria, for instance, the Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) are the main sources of vaccination statistics, but both face substantial underrepresentation of rural and less-educated households. These biases can produce misleading estimates of national immunization coverage and obscure inequities across regions or social groups.

Traditional weighting or post-stratification methods are often used to correct survey imbalances. However, ... [Read complete report:](https://github.com/Paultimi20/Childhood-Immunization-Coverage-Bayesian-Postratification/blob/main/Bayesian_PostStratification_Immunization_Report.pdf)
